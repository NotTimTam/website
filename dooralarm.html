<p>Have you ever wanted to be alerted when someone tries to sneak into your place of residents? Well now you can be!<br>The below video was made in early 2019 by myself. As I was utter cringe then, so was the video. It's probably better if you just read it.... :0</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/alSNlT-r6SY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This project was made with:<br><br>Python3.X (I used PyCharm and will be refering to it and its features in this project)</p>
<a href="https://kano.me/us/store/products/motion-sensor-kit">the KANO Motion Sensor Kit</a>
<p>Any set of speakers to play the audio on the computer.<br><br>Let's begin! First, put the Motion Sensor behind your door. This will determine how "open" the door is.<br>Note: All Python files given to download are in text format, you will need to import the code in these files as '.py's for them to work.</p>
<img src="Images/dooralarmtutorial.png" alt="Door Alarm Example">
<p>Plug the motion sensor into your computer (a usb-extension cable may be required). Now open the Command Prompt and type “mode” this will list the devices plugged into the computer. For me, the motion sensor was COM4. Create a PyCharm project and name it whatever you want. Notice that the code does require some packages that aren’t included with Python. Go ahead and download those using PIP. I created three files, “main.py,” “dooralert.py,” and “playsound.py.” First, we will edit the main file. Add this script to it:</p>

<code>
	<textarea rows="50" cols="80">"""A python project to alert you if you door is open using the KANO Motion Sensor Kit.
Install the motion sensor behind the door, as it reads how close the door is to it backwards..

THIS PROJECT REQUIRES THE KANO MOTION SENSOR KIT. IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT IT."""

root = "./"  # the root folder for imports

import serial, json  # importing stuff to interact with the motion sensor.
import time
import dooralert

s = serial.Serial('COM4')  # opening up serial port four, check what your serial port is in CMD using "mode."

print("Starting up!")  # prints this when the program starts...

#-#-# Defining Variables #-#-#
proximity = 0  # object proximity to sensor.
proximity_opp = 0  # to be used as a percentage of the proximity. (out of 100)
last_proximity_check = 0  # a simple checker to stop the console from being overloaded.
run = True

print("Reading data from:", str(s.port), "\n\n")  # this will be printed showing what port is being read
# from (line above) when

# the program has finished loading in the information.


def wait(countdown_time=10):
    countdown_time += 1
    for i in range(countdown_time):
        countdown_time -= 1
        time.sleep(1)  # set a trap for your friends.
        print("Alarm will be set in", countdown_time, "seconds!\n")


wait(0)  # SET ME UP!!!

while run:  # this code constantly checks the value of the sensor.
    data = json.loads(s.readline())  # reading in the proximity data from the sensor.
    proximity = (data["detail"]["proximity"])  # setting a variable to that data.
    proximity_opp = round((proximity / 255) * 100)  # turning that data into a percent. This is how open the door is.
    if proximity != last_proximity_check:  # printing out the proximity_opp value if the proximity value has changed.
        last_proximity_check = proximity
        # print("Door is", str(proximity_opp) + "% open...")  # A value for debugging to show how open the door is...
    if proximity_opp > 2:  # setting door_open to true if the proximity is greater than five (little bit 'o' leeway)
        print("Egad! It's open.")
        dooralert.door_open_protocol()
        run = False
    else:  # setting door_open to false otherwise...
        print("Nothing to report.")
        print(str(proximity_opp) + "%")</textarea>
</code>
<p>Notice that “s” equals COM4. Change this if necessary. Also notice the “wait(0)” line. Edit this to add a delay so you can leave the room before the sensor starts detecting. Next, edit the “dooralert.py” file… Add this code to it:</p>
<code>
	<textarea rows="50" cols="80">
		""" Child of door-alarm.py, go there for more information... """

import datetime  # giving date and time information to the user.

import time

import playsound

dt = datetime.datetime.now()  # setting up the date and time values from datetime.

def door_open_protocol():  # the code run when the door is seen as open in door-alarm
    file = open("alert_hst.txt", "a")
    file.write("\nALERT: The door was opened on " + str(dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")) + " at " + str(dt.strftime("%H:%M")))
    file.close()
    print("\n\nAlright door protocol, leg'go...\n\n")  # notify the user that this is running
    if dt.hour <= 12:  # all below code is to write out the alert to let the user know, as well as to
        # add it to the file with the history of door openings.
        print("ALERT: The door was opened on " + dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"), "at " + dt.strftime("%H:%M"))
    else:
        print("ALERT: The door was opened on " + dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"), "at " + str(dt.hour - 12) + ":" +
              str(dt.minute))
    print("\nAdded above alert to", file.name + ", which can be found in the main folder")
    playsound.run_sound_alarm()
    file.close()
	</textarea>
</code>
<p>Finally, we will add some code to “playsound.py.”</p>
<code>
	<textarea rows="50" cols="80">"""child of door-alarm.py. Go there for more info.
This script will be uncommented to save time. Basically: it plays a noise when told to by door-alarm.py!"""

import simpleaudio as sa
import time

def run_sound_alarm():
    wave_obj = sa.WaveObject.from_wave_file("alert.wav")
    play_obj = wave_obj.play()
    play_obj.wait_done()</textarea>
</code>
<p>Notice that it requires the “simpleaudio” package to be installed. You must change the line “wave_obj” bit: “from_wave_file” to the correctly named file in your main directory that you want to play when the door alarm gets triggered.
Make sure you have speakers set up with your computer and the volume turned up. Now hit start and open the door! The alarm goes off and information about the time and date the trigger happened is saved to an automatically created file called “alert_hst.txt”! Voilà, now you have a door sensor!

All the files can be found in .py format on the GitHub repository that can be downloaded free of charge!</p>
